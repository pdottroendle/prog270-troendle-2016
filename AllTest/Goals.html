<h3>my name :</h3>
<p>peter-paul troendle</p>
<h3>background :</h3>
<p>digital systems design engineer that realized the increasing pressure of industry cannot be fulfilled with the stagnating hardware architectures of the 70s that are the base of the software development, so it was good in some sense for the software to be able to grow but now that <br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>1. its reached maturity and</li>
<li>2. now that moores law made the hardware hit the quantum wall</li>
<li>3. one can impossibly reduce the size of transistors so moores law ceases</li>
<li>4. the processors cannot be made faster due to the laws of physics: CMOS with "&lt; 10nm" technology are considered to be 1 electron transistors, one electron is also the smallest current and quantum computers are still too expensive ( 1 transistor = 10^12 more expensive than CMOS with a 18nm technology) <br /> <br />its hard for the industry to make faster hardware by technology and the only way forward to make <br />things less laggy and faster is to re-conceive architectures and make the hardware's now progress. <br />Its a bit like when someone is walking one has to move one feet at the time, Hardware moved from <br />the 40s to the 70s and currently Software made a cycle from 80s to now yet it was allowed to have <br />programs more and more complex and "user friendly" because of Moores Law: the Technology allowed <br />faster chips each year. These is one small exception to this, there is in Hardware one architecture <br />that appeared in the 90s and really grown since for niche applications in industry : <br />it is the FPGA that is a 1 bit architecture based on slices and its also more or less stagnating <br />for the last 10 years so really want to see what is possible ahead so I am spending a lot of fun <br />time exploring its very entertaining and so fascinating because many things many people done allready <br />and it shows a general direction that is fascinating its time humanity moves towards it specially now <br />that mecanics made such progress the last centuries and computing and electronics it just started <br /> it is our generation that have to understand our responsability to developp thias very fast because <br />the mechanical sciences are so advances and the means so well distributed yet the means for <br />mankind to boost its intelligence wisdom culture etc.. that are the condition for us to be allowed <br />such powerfull tools that mechanical dveloppments gave us, and I beleive that if we do not make <br />very fast something to boost the capabilities of computing humanity would continue having troubles <br />with how to be using the means without harming itself, therefor I beleive it is time to developp <br />the internet so everyone can enhance its knowledge and intelligens and cultural understanding <br />and also make people happyer with games and arts and all what culture offer, therefore humanity <br />would be more balanced in how to use the powerfull means it has in ways that we still can dream of :)
<h3>goals here :</h3>
I want to get .json .jade .js .project doing what php does and talk to a database from mobile devices with mySQL
<h3>about mobiles :</h3>
I feel concerned by mobiles because of the radiation that seem to give me headaches I would buy one if it had a internet plug but then I guess I prefer the laptop
<h3>sports :</h3>
I like snowsports and watersports anyone doing some ask me to come along
<h3>profile-picture :</h3>
it is me with my favorite car a camaro and I admit its rather small but I feel uncomfortable to have my picture online its because that I value my privacy and already had to try track down some that posted all over peter-paul-troendle.pdf asking for credit card details.
