# creating a webserver in my kitchen
## What a switch can to the new libraries

The CERN had in the 1970s a hudge amount of sophisticated and well cultivated some 
and others less that all needed to communicate and share the information so that is
where some have the idea of connecting the computers to modems, that was an american 
idea allready where they excanged chats instead of phoning. So the idea was to create 
a format for data interchange, and therefor a way of filing and tranmitting etc..
Now were the first machine that was used we see tha computers of those times and
one notice the sticker "DO NOT TURN OFF" one can imagine that an uncultivated cleaner
could have simply pulled the plug to hoover the room !

This is to show the fragility of knowledge and the good things 

That is the reason why Bill Gates wanted to give everyone its computer
so everyone could keep a copy in its local computer that way after a earthquake
the other escaped areas would provide the copies also. 

Its his idea because he made it happen and that made it simple to have then
the machines all connect likle now to the telphone companies the "providers"

now the idea is to have clouds 


- [deleting data on clouds when recurring fee are missing - the isssue](../four/four.html) 
The clouds require caution with respect to the deletion of data because they 
make the keeping of local data and even of a local computer not necessary
so the computers are replaced by mobiles that have hardly no memory and use the cloud
for it but also are vulnerable to it in case of deletion(click link)
