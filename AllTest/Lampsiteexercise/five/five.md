## I'm interested in creating a webserver in my kitchen

every higher level society always strived to preserve and share the excellence and use it as beacon
so the other culturs could orient their own advancement respectively, the idea is that once somethings
is achieved it does not need to be agains so the efforst are better shared and people work more efficiently
on the new things that are needed. Our Scientific revolution of the 19th century did follow the 18tand
17tyh century they called "lumieres" those with light and such as Isaac Newton and other made their
invention but also the first encyclopedia was done by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert

(some notice that this text is repeated from the front page, it is and here this copyed page
was actually done in markdown so it was created and HTML and indexed automatically using the npm node tools 
developped so far, just showing how fats one can add content and should or else Mankind 
if it looses its "memory" might even forgett how to light a fire and rampancy even of avanced
creatures can ahppen fast and keeping the contents fresh and refreshed is the only way to avoid it ever!
