# creating a webserver in my kitchen
## knowledge leakage happened allready

Here the reasons it is:

The fall of the roman empire made the barbaric tribes very interested in the 
plundering and reselling and it was a very prosperous time and age they 
even actually created banks in those ages such the Templars and there it 
was the fouding of the medieval florishing society,nevertheless there was a 
terrible tribute to this revolution that put the roman empire down the drain
it was that many destroyed methods that then took about 2000 to be reinvented
such per example the floor heating and other marvels, some are lost for always

The leaders and some where very wise such Clovis the fouder of the French empire
he caught Generals braking are very valuable vase from a church, the disrespect to
religious and to crafts and cultural symbols was something that could undermine his power
so he slained the General a few years later and told that this vile person was lesser
value than the vase specially that such vile person actually crushed that vase

There are in our last 2nd world war stories of wonderfull floorings that where irreplaceable
and they where torn by some soldiers to make some firewood and that was leaving a very deep
scar to those that survived, sometimes arts is what inspires us and the internet should 
never forgett that or we could also be left with nothing and some would be very ressentfull 
and question us to what we have done
