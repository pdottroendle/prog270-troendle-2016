# creating a webserver in my kitchen

The whole idea of sharing data would be to have a commercial programm
that has the basic version free where all can simply run  it and its bundling
the files in an index and allowing the internet to access it, a hot swap scenarion should
be arranged so machines that close down copy to each other contents and allow
other users to access allways, hence one would have a "phantom cache" where the
backup of the other terminals that shutdown are kept and the own content, basically
its then the idea of sharing and not allowing anythinsg to dissapear erratically

this would use the npm programm written by Charles Calvert and other that use the nodes
and make the adding of contents availabel to all and also the indexing automated and 
therefor allow the sharing

The copyright is for those that should keep the computer shut or in case some work
is stolen and others get paid for it then that money should be restituted, but the
current madness of having beautifull contents removed when one is not selling it
and removing it will not give any more money to the author anyway?

In the contrary it will fall to oblivion forgotten and gone and the author will be poor.

The crafts and arts and science are what make humanity so special

Its the question of putting those that do not understand that back to where they belong
and allow the ones reflecting the the light and arts to brighly enlight their fellows
while those catching fire will be creating that light for us all
