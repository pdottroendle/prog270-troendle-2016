## My First Picture

Here is a screenshot showing the inflating from a zip using the Markdown from Calvin Calvert:

![inflating](../images/inflating.jpg)

Here the CSS version:

```css
img.twenty-five-percent {
   width: 25%;
}
```

This code says that if there is a class of an image tag named **twenty-five-percents** then set its width to 25% of the entire page. Put this CSS in a file called **/var/www/html/css/style.css**. If you have the most recent version of MakeHtml, then the code you put in this file should be reflected in your web pages.

And here is code for using this CSS class:

```html
<img class="twenty-five-percent" src="../images/inflating.jpg" alt="inflating">
```
this is:
<img class="twenty-five-percent" src="../images/inflating.jpg" alt="inflating">
