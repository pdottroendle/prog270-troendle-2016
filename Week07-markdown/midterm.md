# My **midterm** site
## I'm interested in creating a webserver in my kitchen

Here the reasons why:
- [One](one/one.html)
everyone should be able to do so that way the internet will always have copies
and the contents might not leak that easily then if the sleazy sales people
that do not get the subscription fee they simply delete because they do not
understand the value.


- [Two](two/two.html) 
in history some people allready done such vile actions like some that burned 
cultural treasures or destroyed valuable art works ignoring the values its
always important to preserve what cannot be replaced and serves as example to humanity


- [Three](three/three.html)
the internet has to be sustainable even in the worst case (people forgetting to pay the fee)
the way things are getting deleted (geocities, old emails etc..) is a bit risk if one considers
that some emails from the 70s are historic such as those that where from the founders themselves

- [Four](four/four.html)
preserving the work of others is the minimum respect on would show to those that created this
its the idea that there is a common library or cultural repository for mankinds knowlege


- [five](five/five.html)
every higher level society always strived to preserve and share the excellence and use it as beacon
so the other culturs could orient their own advancement respectively, the idea is that once somethings
is achieved it does not need to be agains so the efforst are better shared and people work more efficiently
on the new things that are needed. Our Scientific revolution of the 19th century did follow the 18tand
17tyh century they called "lumieres" those with light and such as Isaac Newton and other made their
invention but also the first encyclopedia was done by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert



so far this is what I achieved and I hope to make this site one day on my kitchen table:

| Git        | localhost         | EC2  
|------------|:------------------|:-------  
| markdown   | markdown master   | markdown  
| npm master | npm nodes         | npm nodes  
|            | webpage(LAN)      | webpage

so everyone can also

Our future is like this little animal it needs to be fostered with care and nurtured:
