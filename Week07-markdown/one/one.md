# creating a webserver in my kitchen
## knowledge leakage

Here the reasons it is:

There are since the industrial revolution a lot of people that **do not need any longer
do the manual work and the skilled work also **so its that what grown the service sector.
The fact is that the generations in it are not totally into **the hard work or creation of real 
items and crafts ** makes it easy for them to forgett the value it has, the uniqueness and treasure
for that reason I use the word unconscious and to put it bluntly basically such people 
when they respect not the work of others and despise the higher values, 
I really must try very hard to not despise them and still actually do so
in fact there is a sense of tastelessness there because what such people propose instead
is an incommensurable amount of spam and worthless garbage they actually try sell.

It is very important to allow a community to keep the values and also the be able to 
cherrish and share what is outstanding so the lesser goods actually go out of the way
and let more room for the better nicer and more exitingh crafts, its the reason I beleive
that the act of deleting should be considered very seriously, its the same as some buildings
or monuments or tree that are protected, there is some data that is irreplaceable specially
the ones that some spend their whole life to build for us all, why should anyone delte that ?

Specially is its just for a couple of dollars when such tresures are far beyond bay values
