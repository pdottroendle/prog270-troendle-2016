# Troendle's Prog270 Repository

Here is where I am putting some of my files from the prog270 winter 2016 class

## Git steps
- git status
- git add README.md
- git status
- git commit -m "My Commit"
- git push

Don't ever do a commit without a -m it opens an editor and you wont be happy if you are in it.
